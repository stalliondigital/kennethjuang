                                threats we identified helped us to establish an initial design focus, that is to
                                identify proper channels for SAHRC to engage with South Asian youths in making health

                                events), alongside pain-points and potential intervention opportunities during the
                                recruitment process. With this, we began to understand why their current methods of

                                where we decided to focus on post-secondary students, since we found these interviewees
                                to be more receptive to changes, especially when it comes to topics pertaining to health

                                communicate with and gain research data from South Asian post-secondary students. These
                                concepts included creating a <em><strong>digital presence</strong></em> for SAHRC,
                                <em><strong>promotional products</strong></em> to familiarize the SAHRC brand, and
                                <em><strong>volunteer onboarding</strong></em> methods. When we proposed our ideas to
                                SAHRC's research coordinator, Aven Sidhu, we learned that data collection is important
                                to SAHRC, but is not their immediate goal. Rather, they are focused on addressing
                                prominent health issues within the South Asian community. We took this meeting
                                opportunity to involve Aven as part of our <em><strong>participatory
                                        workshop</strong></em> to figure out how to pivot our design focus. </p>

                            <p>Through multiple weeks of research, we collected numerous amounts of notes and data. We
                                discovered that there is a struggle to engage with a younger demographic because of
                                untargeted outreach methods. Additionally, heart disease is one of the top health
                                concerns within the South Asian community, mainly due to cultural diets. In the final
                                weeks of the course, we came up with a <em><strong>new design focus</strong></em>: to
                                overcome SAHRC's hurdle of outreach towards South Asian post-secondary students in the
                                Metro Vancouver area by educating them about its effect of heart disease, but also the
                                preventative measures that can be taken to reduce development chances. Although our
                                intervention concept did change, we still retained the core element of our design focus,
                                that is, outreach to make health and well-being a priority, where the <em><strong>value

                                shopping routines (continual use), we focused on the mobile platform. We decided to call

                                from South Asian cuisine. It partners SAHRC with local grocery stores, like Fruiticana,

                            <p>Our first touchpoint takes place at South Asian grocery stores like Fruiticana. At these
                                stores would be a SAHRC booth with free samples of dishes listed on Food for the Heart.
                                A SAHRC member running the booth can introduce our target demographic to both SAHRC and
                                Food for the Heart, as well as the latter's weekly discounts feature. This information
                                is reiterated on info cards that are available at the booth, which students can take
                                home and read later on.</p>

                            <p>From this semester long project, having the chance to apply numerous forms of design
                                methods has taught me just how crucial they are in any design process. Understanding
                                clients and stakeholders is important in determining the focus, but understanding the
                                needs and motivations of the people helps push design, products, and services into the
                                right direction.</p>
                            <p>
                                As this project was my first time practicing these design methods, I've made mistakes in
                                the design process that I have to be mindful of in the future. For instance, my team's
                                first user journey covered an extremely large timeline, causing us to miss out on
                                uncovering meaningful insights. Moving forwards, I am excited to put into practice these
                                interaction design methods into my future projects beyond product and UI/UX design.
                                Working on this project really helped me the importance of understanding stakeholders
                                and communicating their values.
